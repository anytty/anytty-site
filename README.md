AnyTTY keeps terminal sessions running on your own machines, so you can close the window, switch devices, or come back later without losing the work. Use the keyboard-first TUI, CLI, or mobile app to check in, take control, and manage files over the same connection.

> **Beta:** `v0.0.1-beta.0` provides macOS, Linux, Windows, and Android builds for evaluation. Protocols and configuration may still change before the first stable release.

## Key features

- **Close the window, keep the work running.** A `terminal` is a task kept alive by the daemon. TUI `workspaces` and `panels` are just views, so switching which terminal a panel shows doesn't change your layout or restart the task.
- **A slow phone won't slow the task.** TUI panels, the CLI, WebView, and mobile apps each read the latest screen snapshot at their own pace. A slow client can catch up later without making the terminal process wait.
- **Windows, macOS, and Linux all work the same way.** Windows is a first-class platform. The CLI, TUI, and daemon ship for Windows x64 and ARM64, with no WSL required for core functionality.
- **Local and remote terminals in one place.** Local, SSH, Direct, and Cloud terminals appear in the same picker and can be viewed, switched, and operated like local terminals. Remote AI agents can become part of the same workflow.
- **History that doesn't eat memory.** Terminal output is written to history files while the live view keeps only bounded data. There is no fixed history line limit; practical capacity depends on disk space. After a crash, disconnect, or long unattended run, you can recover full context.
- **Find terminals that stopped updating.** The mobile terminal list and TUI picker show status and recent activity together, so you can spot sessions with no new output and decide whether a task is still running.
- **Take control from different devices.** The same terminal can move between the TUI, CLI, embedded WebView, and Android or iOS mobile apps without migrating or restarting the process. Mobile is optimized for touch, with extra keys for `Esc`, `Ctrl`, arrows, paging, and other common actions.
- **Reach private-network machines without exposing them.** The optional AnyTTY Cloud service helps daemons behind NAT or private networks establish P2P connections, with automatic Relay fallback when a direct path is unavailable.
- **Remote connections are encrypted by default.** SSH, Direct, and Cloud routes use authenticated, encrypted connections. Pairing access is bound to a specific client and can be revoked from the daemon. A Relay forwards encrypted traffic without gaining terminal or file permissions.
- **Terminals and files share one connection.** AnyTTY also supports file browsing, upload, download, rename, and selection. After connecting to a remote machine, you can work with authorized files on that machine just as you work with its terminals.
- **Mobile file management and rich previews.** The mobile app includes a file manager that browses remote directories and previews common text, document, image, media, and 3D formats. Logs, configuration, build results, and downloads can be inspected without switching apps.

### Mobile terminals

> **Install the app:** The mobile app supports both Android and iOS. The Android Beta APK is temporarily available from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/anytty/anytty-site/releases/tag/v0.0.1-beta.0). A public iOS build is not yet available and must wait for the Apple App Store release. Google Play and Apple App Store publishing are both in progress.

## Install

### macOS and Linux

The installer selects x64 or ARM64, downloads the matching GitHub Release archive, verifies `SHA256SUMS`, and installs to `~/.local/bin` by default.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anytty/anytty-site/main/install.sh | sh
```

Choose another version or installation directory when needed:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anytty/anytty-site/main/install.sh | \
  sh -s -- --version v0.0.1-beta.0 --bin-dir "$HOME/bin"
```

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anytty/anytty-site/main/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1
.\install.ps1
```

The PowerShell installer verifies SHA-256, installs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\AnyTTY\bin`, and adds that directory to the current user's `PATH`. Pass `-NoModifyPath` to leave `PATH` unchanged.

You can also download CLI archives and the unsigned Android Beta APK directly from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/anytty/anytty-site/releases/tag/v0.0.1-beta.0). Package definitions for Homebrew, npm, and WinGet are being prepared; see [package manager publishing](docs/PACKAGE_MANAGERS.md) for their current status.

## Quick start

Start the daemon for your user and open the TUI:

```sh
anytty daemon start
anytty
```

Create a named terminal from the CLI and attach immediately:

```sh
anytty terminal create --name workspace --attach -- zsh
```

List sessions or return to one later:

```sh
anytty terminal list
anytty attach workspace
```

Run `anytty --help` for the complete command list, or continue with the [quick-start guide](https://anytty.github.io/anytty-site/docs/quick-start.html).

## Mobile app

Install the Android Beta APK from the release page, then choose **Add device** in the app. On the machine running the daemon, use `anytty pair create` to generate a short-lived pairing QR code or text claim, then scan or paste it in the app. Once paired, the device page lists running terminals and opens the file browser from a terminal's working directory.

The mobile app supports Android and iOS. The Android Beta APK is currently available from the release page; iOS does not yet have a public install and is waiting for Apple App Store publication. Official Google Play and Apple App Store releases are both in progress.

## Connection options

| Route | Best for | Cloud required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local | CLI and TUI on the same machine | No |
| SSH | Machines you already reach through OpenSSH | No |
| Direct | Self-managed LAN or publicly reachable environments | No |
| Cloud | Managed device discovery, P2P negotiation, and Relay fallback | Yes |

Local, SSH, and Direct work entirely from this repository. Cloud is optional: it changes how you reach a machine, not who controls terminal and file permissions.

## Build from source

CLI/TUI development requires Go 1.26.5. Shared UI and mobile builds use Node.js 24 and the checked-in npm lockfile.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/anytty/anytty-site.git
cd anytty-site
npm ci
make build
```

The binary is written to `.artifacts/bin/anytty`. Run the main checks with `make test`, `make test-clients`, and `npm run public:check`. Android builds additionally require Java 21 and the Android SDK; iOS builds require macOS and Xcode.

## Open source and AnyTTY Cloud

The Apache-2.0 version includes the CLI, TUI, daemon, shared UI, Android and iOS source, plus Local, SSH, and Direct connection options. You can use it directly to manage local and remote terminals, files, and long-running tasks, and build clients for each platform.

On top of that, AnyTTY provides an official managed Cloud service for device discovery, P2P negotiation, and Relay fallback when a direct connection is unavailable, making terminals behind NAT or private networks easier to reach securely. Cloud is an optional ready-to-use service; terminal and file permissions stay with your daemon. See the [security boundary](docs/SECURITY_BOUNDARY.md) for the user-visible trust model.
