## Unreleased

## [0.0.1-beta.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- Added a bilingual Markdown documentation site, GitHub Pages Actions, local build previews, and configuration for a future `anytty.com` custom domain.
- Added community governance documents, issue and pull request templates, CODEOWNERS, Dependabot, and a release checklist for the Apache-2.0 project.
- Added automated checks for HTML and Markdown links, bilingual page structure, sensitive paths, private imports, and potential credential files.
- Added Local, SSH, Direct, and Cloud routes to the endpoint registry, with tests and diagnostic commands.
- Added one-time QR pairing. The Android app adds devices only through explicit pairing and does not log in or auto-discover account devices.
- Added baseline-driven Full/Delta terminal updates, paginated history, search, range copy, and continuous switching between Live and History views.
- Added optional AnyTTY Cloud connectivity with managed device discovery, P2P negotiation, Relay fallback, and connection-path refresh without restarting the daemon.
- Added searchable Cloud product documentation with responsive navigation.
- Added complete project READMEs, stable topic guides, and repository documentation indexes.

### Changed

- PTY output now uses one bounded payload per terminal, consumed by independent Live and History cursors. Overflow behavior can be configured as `block` or `drop`.
- The TUI and mobile clients reattach long polls immediately after submitting the current renderer batch instead of using a fixed frame-rate window. Updates arriving during rendering are merged into the latest damage instead of queuing stale frames.
- App backgrounding, WebView reloads, and native session generation changes cancel stale requests and restore sessions from the local endpoint registry.
- History mode freezes its visual anchor on entry, returns to Live automatically at the newest position, and materializes large copy ranges only when confirmed.
- Cloud routes change discovery and transport only; the daemon remains the authority for terminal and file permissions.
- The repository layout guard now checks stable documents, invalid output paths, and build artifacts without restricting additional Markdown files.

### Security

- Terminal and file permissions are enforced by the daemon through client-bound capability grants.
- Pairing claims are short-lived, one-time credentials; access grants are bound to a client identity and enforced by the daemon.
- Remote connections authenticate the daemon identity. Identity, authentication, or authorization failures are rejected without weakening checks through route fallback.
- Credentials use protected storage and atomic updates. Logs do not record secrets, terminal content, or file content.

### Removed

- Removed the assumption that account devices should be auto-discovered by the mobile app. Cloud accounts and the app endpoint registry remain independent.
- Removed duplicate TUI configuration templates, completed remediation plans, obsolete design drafts, and outdated development workflow documents.
- Removed compatibility promises for unreleased legacy protocols, YAML files, and development data formats.
